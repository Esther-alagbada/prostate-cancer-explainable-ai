# Explainable Multi-Task Deep Learning for Prostate Cancer Detection

## Overview
This project develops an explainable multi-task deep learning framework for prostate cancer detection using multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI). The system performs clinically significant cancer classification and lesion localization while integrating explainable AI methods to improve transparency and clinical trust.

## Objectives
- Develop a deep learning model for prostate cancer classification
- Implement lesion localization/segmentation
- Integrate Grad-CAM explainability
- Benchmark against existing methods

## Project Structure
This repository will contain:
- Data processing pipeline
- Model development code
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Results and visualizations
